# nobs-url
nobs-url is a tool and library for removing [bs](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=BS) from URLs.

## Principles
- nobs-url is not (only) about URL shortening
- a nobsed URL should be crafted, when possible, from the core elements of the original (e.g. Spotify track ID, or Reddit post ID), not by removing stuff. This creates better URLs by declaration.
